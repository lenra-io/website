        p
            | The platform is made to optimize online resources, using Flutter (optimized interface management), Elixir (optimized communications), and additional developments (optimized data management by the fact that the platform manages both the client and the server, the data exchanged will only be new or updated data).

        p
            | Hosting the components of the platform and the apps stored in the Lenra system will lean within european union by european companies, outside what we consider a threat for personal data (like the U.S Cloud Act).

        p 
            | Lenra is Big techs free and uses none of their service or components (even if some technologies are made by FAANG, like Flutter ‚Äìbut it's open source now).
        h4(data-emoji="üßë‚Äçüíª") With an open-source solution 
        p
            | The open source aspect of the Lenra components guarantees transparency and allows anyone to take ownership of the platform, to use it in a independant way or to make it evolve through time.
            | Although accessing apps via the App Store or Play Store is known to offer the best possible performance on mobile devices, the Lenra system leaves the choice to the user of how to access apps.
            | In particular, access via web browser will be possible.
            | This will also extend with the objective to propose the Lenra system to independent mobile operating systems (we already have contact with the /e/ foundation).

            | Authorizations will be automatically requested as the user wants to manage data in other environments outside the Lenra system (connection to an external server for instance) or needs to manage data in the app system.
